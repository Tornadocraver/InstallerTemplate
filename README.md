# InstallerTemplate

This template is meant for use in Visual Studio. The completed template is called 'Installer_Template' and
contains all the necessary files and code to work with your application. Please read the file entitled 
'README.txt' once you have imported the template. The text file also contains the license for use of this
project. If you find any bugs/have any edits that need to me made, please let me know ASAP. I will be up-
loading a tutorial soon showing how to use this template.
